# Error-Handling-Project
The Project Aims to Automate identifying, filtering and make the complex tasks of parsing huge log files to identify errors when running a program in a computer.
Languages used:
  Bash
  Python
  Cmd interface
 The process is as easy as suppling a log file to the script which then returns the filtered log lines based on a template error.
 This initial idea could further catalyse and AI based system so it can process any type of error types.
